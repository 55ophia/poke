# welcome to our game #
This is heavily pokemon inspired, and we all came together to create this game, essentially from scratch.

Move the character using WASD, and check around the island for specific spots, and these will trigger battles ! good luck exploring and finding them :D

Once in a battle, there will be specific attacks that deal different amounts of damage, do your best to defeat the enemy pokemon!.

If you have time, enjoy the lovely scenery of your island, poke ! (or whatever you want to name it) There's lovely oceans, lakes, and houses that are currently empty, but hopefully there will be some neighbors soon...

# some coding tips... #
- be sure to "git pull" every time there is a change that is created
- there are a couple different files for organization, like html.index, js.index, and the classes.js file. make sure you organize these and use them accordingly.
    - javascript is your best friend in this game, it's basically all javascript. 
    - there's some links to gsap? figure it out and add it to the repo

- git hub is the running website for this game, it is the way that it runs and how it's uploaded online, check out the repo, poke.
    - some special commmands
    - we are using a makefile, so running make will get your server up and running, and make stop will stop the game. use make clean to sync notebooks and make sure everything is in order before you run make.

our entire game runs on the very front page of the game, so no need to worry about finding where our game is. Most of the code is behind the scenes as well, so make sure you're checking the repo. 

Happy coding!

## things we learned ##
... maybe the things we learned were the friends along the way
the super code in JS is about calling to a parent class about its constructors, you will see it frequently in js classes and other stuff.

the use of classes hurray we are making lots of classes for sprites and movements and collisions!

whenever player hits collisions, they stop! hence the character will not run off the entire map hururay. 

## our aspirations at the start ##
To be honest, we were planning on going into the game blindly, and somehow coding everything ourselves. But, this was obviously impossible because we didn't learn any code on our own and we were expected to produce a game. 

So goodbye to the pigeon and egg, and the 2d mario style game that we had in store, it was a good attempt. 

We found a new video that would walk us through this incredibly challenging process, as well as actually explaining the code that was happening, which was refreshing compared to our other resources...

We hope that this pokemon game will be a cute, fun spin-off of an actual pokemon game, complete with its flashing lights and unique attacks. 

## our aspirations now ##
If anyone were to pick up this project, we hope that you guys can add some more options and variety with the pokemon that we face, or maybe a capturing option so we can add to our "pokedex." 

We originally wanted a start menu as well, and we specifically added the houses so we could have a healing center, with npcs like nurse joy. 

Animal crossing aspects, like fishing, or doing domestic activities around the island is a must !!

# the end credits #
Andrew hand drew all of the sprites that are used in this game, like the characters, pokemon, and any other settings or images you might see. Aanya spent her time and effort creating a dragong that would be our pokemon in this setting.

Sophia used TileSet and drew out every single map for this game, including landscaping the rivers and each individual edge in the game.

Then, Andrew, Katie, and worked on the code to make the game come together. This started with collisions that would prohibit the player from moving off the map, creating js classes and objects, and using those to create a battle.

Biggest credit to the creator of the video, Chris Courses. He has a 7 hour video that walked beginner coders like us through this insane game.
